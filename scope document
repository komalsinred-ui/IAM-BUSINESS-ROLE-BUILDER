Phase 2 – Completed (Engine + API + UI MVP)

✔ Business Role Builder (BRB)
- Deterministic bundle discovery using activity-role co-occurrence (pairs/triples)
- Dynamic support thresholds for small cohorts (effective_itemset_support adjustment)
- Confidence tiers (STRONG / MEDIUM / WEAK)
- Explainable rationale per suggestion (coverage + thresholds used)

✔ SoD Guard (Rule-based + Heuristic)
- Severity-aware SoD framework
- Heuristic SoD detection using privilege / finance / approval keyword signals
- Bundle-level SoD risk scoring (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) with conflict details
- New-joiner recommendations support “block_high_sod” policy

✔ Access Ratio Evaluator
- Role coverage and usage insights (foundation for unused/bloat detection)
- User access summaries + overlap signals (future: deeper role cleanup)

✔ New Joiner Access Recommendation
- Cohort-based access recommendation (job_code + supervisor/department)
- Support-threshold driven recommendations with SoD policy applied
- Exportable, audit-friendly outputs

✔ API + UI (Phase 2 Layer)
- FastAPI contract exposing the engine as stable endpoints
- Streamlit dashboard with filters, diagnostics, explainability, and exports
- “Diagnose why empty” to debug thresholds and cohort constraints

✔ Export + Audit
- CSV export for stakeholder review and audit traceability
