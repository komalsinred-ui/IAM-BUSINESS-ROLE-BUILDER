PROJECT BRB - Requirements & Scope

We’re building an IAM Role Intelligence Assistant with these modules:

BRB – Business Role Builder (bundle ARs into BR candidates)
Business Role Builder

Focus: Proactive construction of optimized Business Roles

Bundles commonly co-requested or co-assigned activity roles

Suggests naming, justification, SoD compliance

Goal: Reduce request frequency, streamline approvals

Proposed Business Role	Included Activity Roles	BU	Confidence	SoD Conflict	Auto-Approval Feasible	AI Justification	Action
DataEng_Analytics_Read	R101, R105, R108	Data Eng	92%	No	Yes	Assigned together 88% of time; same team	[View Details]
DataEng_ETL_Manager	R102, R110	Data Eng	87%	Yes (Policy#14)	No	Co-requested, but triggers SoD	[View Details]
DataEng_Temp_Contract	R107, R109	Data Eng	76%	No	Yes	Temporary roles used in onboarding	[View Details]

Role Explorer (overlap/duplicate/unused roles by BU/team/department)
Smart Role Analyzer

Focus: Detect issues in existing roles

Duplicate roles

Overlapping roles

Unused/outliers

Output: Tagging and diagnostics

Use Case: Role Simplification

Role A	Role B	Entitlement Overlap	SoD Conflict	Risk Level	Suggested Action
R101	R103	82%	Yes (Policy#12)	                 High         Flag for separation
R104	R105	89%	None	                         Medium	      Merge recommended

Access Ratio Evaluator (usage insights: entitlement/role utilization, coverage, bloat)

New Joiner Access Recommender (recommend access based on job/supervisor/peers)

SoD Guard (prevent recommending conflicting access)

Chat + Export + Audit (ask questions, export outputs, trace decisions)

AWS Deployment + Bedrock (LLM for explanations & intent routing)


Personas

Identity Design Analysts (primary)

Later: role owners / line managers / BAU heads

Pain points to solve

Manual bundling of Activity Roles (ARs) into Business Roles (BRs)

Approval bottlenecks (approving individual ARs)

Lack of standardization

Role overlap/redundancy (future: SoD checks)

Objectives / goals

Automate role identification/modeling from identity + HR data

Consistent, objective criteria (not analyst intuition)

Scale to large hierarchies

Streamline role mgmt/reporting/auditing (future)

Leverage identity role metadata + job codes + access patterns (job/access patterns noted as future iteration in your doc)

Scope

“All human user accounts within identity”

Focus grouping by Supervisory Hierarchy level (e.g., SH/L6)

brb_core/synthetic_data.py

Purpose:
Simulates realistic IAM data so the system can be developed and tested without production access.

What it does:

Generates users under supervisors

Assigns job codes, departments, assignment types

Ensures some roles are common (signal) and some are random (noise)

Mimics real-world IAM distributions using randomness

Why it exists:
To validate logic, thresholds, and edge cases before integrating real HR / SailPoint data.

📁 brb_core/bundling.py

Purpose:
Identifies Business Role candidates using deterministic logic.

What it does:

Groups users by org context (e.g., supervisor + job code)

Finds frequent pairs and triples of activity roles

Applies thresholds:

minimum group size

minimum role support

minimum bundle support

Tags suggestions (Birthright / Job-Based / Department)

Key idea:
“If a set of roles appears together for most users in a cohort, it’s a business role candidate.”

📁 brb_core/metrics.py

Purpose:
Provides role usage intelligence (Access Ratio Evaluator).

What it does:

Calculates role coverage (% of users with a role)

Identifies unused / low-use roles

Builds per-user access summaries

Detects overlapping roles using Jaccard similarity

Why it matters:
Supports governance, cleanup, audits, and explains why roles exist.

📁 brb_core/sod_rules.py

Purpose:
Defines Segregation of Duties (SoD) policy framework.

What it does:

Stores SoD conflict rules with severity (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

Detects conflicts in a proposed role set

Applies policy:

blocks HIGH severity

warns on MEDIUM / LOW

Design choice:
Rule-based + severity-aware → audit-friendly and extensible later.

📁 brb_core/new_joiner.py

Purpose:
Recommends access for new joiners in a controlled, explainable way.

What it does:

Builds a cohort (job code + supervisor/department)

Recommends roles used by most users in that cohort

Applies SoD policy and removes high-risk roles

Outputs coverage %, reasons, and SoD details

Key point:
This is recommendation, not auto-provisioning.

📁 brb_core/run_local.py

Purpose:
Local orchestration layer (Phase 1 pipeline runner).

What it does:

Generates synthetic IAM data

Runs bundling engine

Runs metrics + overlap analysis

Runs new joiner recommendation

Exports all outputs to CSV

Why it’s important:
Acts as the backbone that later becomes:

Lambda / ECS job

API backend

MLOps pipeline entry point

📁 data/

Raw synthetic IAM extracts

Mimics upstream HR / IAM feeds

📁 outputs/

bundle_suggestions.csv → BR candidates

role_metrics.csv → access ratios

user_access_summary.csv → per-user insight

role_overlap_top50.csv → duplicate/overlap roles

new_joiner_recommendation.csv → onboarding access

🔑 One-line summary (use this in interviews)

“I built a deterministic IAM intelligence engine that identifies business role candidates, evaluates role usage, recommends new-joiner access with SoD controls, and exports audit-ready outputs — all before adding GenAI for explanation and interaction.”
