PROJECT BRB - Requirements & Scope

Personas

Identity Design Analysts (primary)

Later: role owners / line managers / BAU heads

Pain points to solve

Manual bundling of Activity Roles (ARs) into Business Roles (BRs)

Approval bottlenecks (approving individual ARs)

Lack of standardization

Role overlap/redundancy (future: SoD checks)

Objectives / goals

Automate role identification/modeling from identity + HR data

Consistent, objective criteria (not analyst intuition)

Scale to large hierarchies

Streamline role mgmt/reporting/auditing (future)

Leverage identity role metadata + job codes + access patterns (job/access patterns noted as future iteration in your doc)

Scope

“All human user accounts within identity”

Focus grouping by Supervisory Hierarchy level (e.g., SH/L6)
